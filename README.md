**TerrainNet: A User-Friendly Terrain Analysis Tool for Defense and Paramilitary Operations**

TerrainNet is an advanced terrain analysis software designed specifically for defense and paramilitary forces. Leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology, TerrainNet provides accurate and efficient terrain classification to support decision-making in reconnaissance and surveillance missions.

**Features:**

- **CNN-Based Classification:** TerrainNet utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a diverse dataset of terrain imagery.
  
- **High Accuracy:** The CNN model, trained on 30 epochs, achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.6% in classifying four main terrain types: mountain, plain, desert, and forest.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** TerrainNet features an intuitive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface tailored specifically for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operators. This interface ensures ease of use and seamless interaction during mission-critical operations.

- **Backend Integration:** Developed using Flask and integrated with TensorFlow, TerrainNet's backend ensures smooth communication between the user interface and the CNN model, enabling real-time terrain analysis.
